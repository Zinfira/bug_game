## Try your luck! ;)

By Zinfira Timofeev

## Description

This is a simple card game. It's created by me using vanilla JavaScript.

### Game instructions:

1. The first screen asks a user for the level of difficulty. The number of cards depends on the difficulty level.
Easy level - 3 cardsl.
Medium level - 6 cards.
Hard level -  10 cards.
2. After selecting the difficulty level, the user clicks on the "Start Game" button.
3. Then the Game Table appears. All card meanings are hidden. All cards except one are blank. One of the cards is a bug.
4. The user can choose any card.
5. After clicking on the card, the card flips over with a little bit of animation.
6. The card can have two meanings:
- A blank card;
- A bug card;
7. Then the user can click on the card and restart the game - step 1.
